1. Can you code?


2. Interview
 - Communication, brainstorming
 - Understanding of fundamentals (stats, deep learning, ML) - but 
       specific to job description
 - Problem-solving skills

Tips: 
- don't answer questions right away (take your time)
- repeat/reword the question to the interview (to show understanding / clarify confusion)
- should at least know the basics (not necessarily the math) for entry-level positions


Knowing the pros/cons will take your answer to next level
Study up on core statistics,   e.g. what is Baye's Thereom.


FP: ensure on sufficient computational resources. Focus on one (pictures/music) at a time.
Focus on dataset that is artistic, keep it lo-fi  32x32,  64x64.
Present images across epochs (show improvement)
Get TF-GPU set up and make sure I can generate images in a reasonable amount of time!

      "Not only that, but you’ve reached the point where even the thought of the goal, brings the feeling of having butterflies in your stomach. Demon butterflies.\n",
      "Hopefully, today is the day you will break the chain as well.\n",
      "Let me help you with that.\n",
      "First, the explanation.\n",
      "In the beginning, when we set the goal, we feel usually motivated, for about a day. As each additional day passes, the resistance starts to grow.\n",
      "As more time passes by, we feel more overwhelmed, especially if we have attempted to start several times, and failed. It stacks up, but in a wrong direction.\n",
      "The biggest problem in this scenario is that we think of the sheer size of the goal, or to be more accurate, the list of the activities we need to do, and how much time it will take us to do them all.\n",
      "We think about the big picture.\n",
      "There is nothing wrong with the big picture, on the contrary, we need it, but in the beginning, when it’s the planning phase.\n",
      "Immediately once the plan is finished, you should leave the big picture aside and focus on the small one.\n",
      "To be specific, just one day ahead of you. Or, as I like to call it “A 24 Hour Life”(basically what smarter people before me said but rephrased with a cooler name, fancy, I know).\n",
      "That’s what you should do. Don’t think about the science or that you need 66 days to establish a habit, it will just overwhelm you additionally, which you don’t need.\n",
      "Next, to the “ONE DAY” principle, the only other one you need is the consistency.\n",
      "If necessary, sacrifice the quality, and the quantity, for the sake of consistency.\n",
      "Let’s get down to concrete steps you can take a right this moment to take action and start working on your goal.\n",

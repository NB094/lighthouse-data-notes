Notes:
1. Why do flights get delayed? (traffic? Weather (look up API)?)  Can look at other datasets out there to complement results.
2. Spend first couple days exploring datasets, write some hypotheses.
3. Sunday to Monday: feature engineering
4. Beginning of Tuesday: have baseline model created
5. Tuesday-Thursday: hyperparameter tuning, testing other models
6. Split up tasks; lots of ground to cover
7. Check out exploratory_analysis workbook for a start. Also explore data in different ways.

8. Drop the specified variables from the predictors (CARRIER_DELAY, WEATHER_DELAY, etc.)
	However, you can take (e.g.) historical averages of these values and feature-engineer them into the model.
9. Each row is 1 flight.
10. Try running models on Google Colab so we can do other stuff while we wait.
11. Try sampling data from December/January since there are a lot of rows of data. State any methods we used.
12. Really hard to get a good score. Most R2 scores are 0.08 to 0.15. Keep track of improvements over model iterations.
	Upper bound: 0.18-0.22 (very few students)
	Top score: 0.4+
13. Also consider other metrics, like MAE.
14. Title sections? Iteration 1, Iteration 2, ...., Iteration n.
15. Keep code quality high from the get-go; it is getting reviewed!
	Include	Docstrings for functions. ( ''' ) See Slide 30.
	Use "Pickling" to save models.
16. Google Colab uses new environments for each notebook. You can install stuff with !pip install <...>, if needed.
	Consider mounting Google Drive to Google Colab.


Approach:
1. Reading the project requirements, understanding the problem
2. Drop unneccesary columns
2. Get data from Dec/Jan 2018/2019, exploratory data analysis (EDA)    Aim to have 100,000 - 500,000 observations
3. Preprocess / Clean Data
4. Google causes of flight delays (incorporate into dataset if possible)
5. Feature engineering/selection, hypothesize on important features
6. Create baseline model
7. Iterations (different models, different hyperparameters; grid-searching)
